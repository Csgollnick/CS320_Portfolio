How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure the operational capacities of my code or programs, we can write unit tests to test the functions thatare conatined within.
By writing unit tests we can focus in on particular elements and pass values to those methods to test if they work under standard expected usage.
Likewise we can also write tests to check for what occurs when not the expected happens.  For example, we can test for an exception to be thrown
when too many characters are entered in to the name field.  Successful passge of such tests ensure that the program is operating and running. We
can also run as coverage to validate how much of the program our unit tests are actually testing.  By utilizing this, we can continue to measure 
the percentage tested aiming for the 80% minimum.  By testing to this threshold we can ensure that the software is functioning at acceptable or 
better standards under testing and ready for execution tests.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpretation of user needs usual comes in the veyr beginning.  By communicating with the user or client, we can ascertain what they expect
the software to do.  In the case of the contact files, the requirements file which simulates the customer expectation set forth very clearly 
what they expected.  A unique ID no longer than 10 characters, first name and last names no longer than 10 characters, 10 digit phone number
and address no more than 30 characters. None of which could be left empty.  A real scenario may not be so cut and dry and learning to listen,
analayze, and extrapolate from a customers words becomes necesarry to find the information we need to ensure the program meets their 
requirements.  In testing we may find new scenarios that as well they may add features for the customer.  Such in this case, we tested for 
adding multiple contacts.  Nothing in the requirements data said the customer would do this, but in testing we need to ensure that it exists 
as a possible scenario and that we can make it work.  In the end, we end up with a working possible solution for it and it becomes a feature
that the customer may not have thought of but might be enthused about now that it exists.

How do I approach designing software?
Designing software, to me, is no different of a mind set than designing sound or lights for a film or theatrical production or composing the 
score to such either.  Everything begins and ends with the client and what they want.  In the arts, the director has a vision for the medium
and it becomes my job as the designer to take that vision and connect what they explicitly and implicitly say they want as part of it as well
as imbue it with my knowledge and expertise in design to create a desired, working, and accepted end product.  In software, we need to talk 
to the client and ascertain what their ideas and needs are for the software.  For many of these elements they will explicitly tell us they 
want it to perform a  specific task.  We also need to be cognizant of things they allude to or imply would be things they want it to do or 
nice to have.  Once I have these items I can break them down into a list form to better see all the needed requirements.  From there 
its about building the program to incorporate the clients requirements.  During the process, my knowledge and expertise will be utilized as 
I will need to determine how these different requirements connect or talk to each other. Then in testing, I need to consider the bigger picture 
of how the product gets used.  How I intended it to be used when I wrote it versus all the scenarios I can determine how the client will 
actually use it.  At this point I may now find newer ways that methods can be executed or new feature thats not in there that may benefit the
client.  At which point, I go back to developing the program and incorporate these things.  Designing becomes about finding the required needs,
identifying the nice to haves, discovering the unknown needs, and marrying them all together into a cohesive program always bearing in mind
what the final outcome should be so we never lose sight of that goal.
